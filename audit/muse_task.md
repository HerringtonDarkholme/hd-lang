# Muse

Muse's work queue (owner, 2026-10-10: one task file, `audit/muse_task.md`;
the older `opus_task.md` and `kimi_task.md` are gone, and
git history keeps them). The orchestrating session adds jobs here. Do
them top to bottom, one commit per job, and delete a job's section in the
commit that finishes it. When the queue is empty, report that and wait.

## How To Work

- Owner direction, 2026-10-10: do not align native runtime behavior to
  Node.js. Node behavior is subject to change. Follow the spec and owner
  decisions; cross-engine comparisons are evidence, not semantic authority.
- Work in **one** long-lived git worktree of your own, for example
  `git worktree add /private/tmp/muse-work -b muse/work origin/main`
  the first time, and reuse it. Never write in the shared main checkout
  `/Users/hd/code/test/hd-lang`.
- Start each job from current main: `git fetch origin && git reset --hard
  origin/main`, but only when the worktree holds no unpushed work.
- Use a scratch `HD_CACHE` directory inside your worktree for every `hd`
  run and every cargo test run. Never run two full test runs at once, and
  don't start one while another agent's full run is going (check `uptime`;
  above ~30, wait).
- **Gates before every push** (always the dev profile, never `--release`; owner, 2026-10-11) (from `compiler/`): `cargo fmt --check`;
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`;
  `HD_UPDATE_CONFORMANCE=1 cargo test -q --workspace`, then the
  same without the env var; and `bash spec/check.sh` from the repository
  root. Never push with any of them red.
- Push with `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`, rerun the gates
  if main moved, then `git push origin HEAD:main`. Never force-push. Add
  files by name, never `git add -A`. A job is done only when its commit
  is on `origin/main`.
- One-line commit subjects under 72 characters, a blank line, then the
  body.
- Never read or print credential files or secret environment variables.

## Don't Touch

- `spec/`: **frozen**. No edits to rule text, std chapters, conformance
  fixtures or indexes. Log any spec or fixture issue as a row in
  `audit/compiler/diagnostic-notes.md` and go on.
- `compiler/crates/`: the orchestrator's lane, **except the files a job
  names**.
- `src/` (the frozen TS prototype), `lib/std/`, `website/`, `guide/`:
  read only.

## Jobs

No jobs remain.

(Owner, 2026-10-11: Codex finishes M24 and then goes offline. M23, M16 and
M17 moved back to the orchestrator's task list; git history keeps their
text. Stop after M24.)
